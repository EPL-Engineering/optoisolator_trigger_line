# Optoisolator Trigger Line Circuit

## Description
The optoisolator circuit in its current state only supports two channels. A PCB has been designed to support 8 optocoupled digital IO channels. The parts have been ordered and the board just needs to be assembled and installed.

## TODO
- Solder components to PCB
- Create custom cables with sub-D connectors on both ends
- Validate functionality and install
